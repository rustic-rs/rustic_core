## About

This library is a part of the [rustic](https://rustic.cli.rs) project and
provides a set of types for the
[`rustic_core`](https://crates.io/crates/rustic_core) library. It is used to
collect everything regarding configuration for backends, CLI, and other related
functionality.

**Note**: `rustic_config` is in an early development stage and its API is
subject to change in the next releases. If you want to give feedback on that,
please open an [issue](https://github.com/rustic-rs/rustic_core/issues).

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rustic_config = "0.1"
```

<!-- ## Crate features

This crate exposes a few features for controlling dependency usage:

- **cli** - Enables support for CLI features by enabling `merge` and `clap`
  features. *This feature is disabled by default*.

- **clap** - Enables a dependency on the `clap` crate and enables parsing from
  the commandline. *This feature is disabled by default*.

- **merge** - Enables support for merging multiple values into one, which
  enables the `merge` dependency. This is needed for parsing commandline
  arguments and merging them into one (e.g. `config`). *This feature is disabled
  by default*. -->

## Usage & Examples

Due to being a support crate for
[`rustic_core`](https://crates.io/crates/rustic_core), there are no examples
here. Please check the examples in the
[`rustic_core`](https://crates.io/crates/rustic_core) crate.

## Minimum Rust version policy

This crate's minimum supported `rustc` version is `1.76.0`.

The current policy is that the minimum Rust version required to use this crate
can be increased in minor version updates. For example, if `crate 1.0` requires
Rust 1.20.0, then `crate 1.0.z` for all values of `z` will also require Rust
1.20.0 or newer. However, `crate 1.y` for `y > 0` may require a newer minimum
version of Rust.

In general, this crate will be conservative with respect to the minimum
supported version of Rust.
